- The `functions` are attached to the corresponding buttons in the HTML file using `event listeners`. When a button is clicked, the associated function is called, performing the `Lodash operation` and outputting the result to the console.
- Overall, this code provides an example of how to use Lodash library functions in a web application and demonstrates various operations like `chunking arrays, accessing elements, finding objects, sorting arrays, and calculating sums`.
