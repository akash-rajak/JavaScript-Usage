### Summary of code:
- This code sets up a basic `p5.js Library` application that demonstrates `drawing and interaction with the canvas using the mouse position`.
- When we open the `index.html` file in a web browser, you will see a web page with the heading `p5.js Usage` centered at the top. Below the heading, there is a `canvas` representing the `p5.js sketch`. 
- As we move the mouse `inside` the canvas, a `red circle` will follow the mouse position. The background of the page is set to light yellow.

### IMP Points:
