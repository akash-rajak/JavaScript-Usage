## âœ” TypeScript Usage
- Curated use of TypeScript Technology.

### Usage points:
- After creating the `index.html` and `type.ts` file, we cannot start the HTML file or run the typescript file directly, because Typescript file cannot be interpreted by browser directly, so there is a need to compile it to a Javascript file.
- In order to compile the Typescript file(.ts) file into a Javascript file(.js), first need to install the Typescript (tsc) using following command. Open CMD and run the below command
```
npm install -g typescript
```
- for reference in installing typescript : [LINK](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12685995/cant-find-typescript-compiler-command-tsc-is-not-valid)
- Now to we can compile the `type.ts` file using below command
```
tsc type.ts
```
- After this command, .ts file gets compiled and a new Javascript file is being created in same folder with same folder as the typescript file(here `type.js`), that contains the equivalent Javascript code for the TypeScript code.
- Now we can run the Javascript file `type.js` file using the below command the see the console output:
```
node type.js
```
- Below is the output after running above command:

- Now we can run the `inde.html` file using the following command
```
start index.html
```
- this command will open the default browser, which looks like below
