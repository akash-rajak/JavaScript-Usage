# âœ” TypeScript Usage
- Curated use of TypeScript Technology.

****

### TypeScript Installation:
- Inorder to run the typescript(.ts) file, we need to install the typescript.
- Run the following command in cmd(from window)
```
npm install -g typescript
```
- Add the `npm path` to the `Environment Variables`.

- After adding PATh to Environment Variables, try running the trypescrit(.ts) file, using below command in the code
```
tsc type.ts
```
- if this command gives below error regarding `Execution Policy` as below, then we need to change the `Execution Policy in our system`.

- We can do this by running the following command in `Window PowerShell` by running as an Administrator.
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

- After doing this, when we try running the typescript file using the `tsc type.ts` command, it will run perfectly and generates the equivalent `type.js` file.

### Usage points:
- After creating the `index.html` and `type.ts` file, we cannot start the HTML file or run the typescript file directly, because Typescript file cannot be interpreted by browser directly, so there is a need to compile it to a Javascript file.
- Compile the `type.ts` file using below command
```
tsc type.ts
```
- After this command, .ts file gets compiled and a new Javascript file is being created in same folder with same folder as the typescript file(here `type.js`), that contains the equivalent Javascript code for the TypeScript code.
- Now we can run the Javascript file `type.js` file using the below command the see the console output:
```
node type.js
```
- Below is the output after running above command:

- Now we can run the `index.html` file using the following command
```
start index.html
```
- this command will open the default browser, which looks like below

- We can click on the `Load TypeScript` button and see the output triggering on the `console` output under `inspect` section, as below:
